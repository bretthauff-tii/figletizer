# figletizer
A truely terrible PHP app that provides a web frontend to the linux cli ASCII art tool `figlet`
It's not at all set up for variablization, runtime location detection or any reasonable expectations.

## requirements / installation
* install figlet with your distro's package manager
* install a webserver and set it to be able to run php
* put the files in that dir
* update all the hardcoded paths
